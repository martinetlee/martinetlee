Hello, friends! :four_leaf_clover:

Welcome to this humble place. I hope you found some of the things here useful. 

A little about me: I'm an enthusiast in using technology to bring equality to humanity. 
I have many faces: I've translated books, published boardgames, been a well-known teacher in Taiwan, and at the same time I'm an engineer with a focus in blockchain and security. 
I have experience in both software and hardware and currently working as a security auditor / research engineer.

I've been thinking a lot on how to create a safer and a happier world. :grin:

I love projects that aim to help people. These include (but not limited to!) ensuring people's privacy, promote freedom and democracy, economic safety (such as UBI), education, and protecting people from bad actors.
